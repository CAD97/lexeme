This crate provides a crate to define a simple [lexer] using [regex]. This is
similar to [Logos]; however, lexeme uses the regex crate directly, rather than
implementing its own parsing routines. This makes lexeme much simpler to
maintain than Logos, while still retaining ludicrous speed, thanks to the regex
crate's performance.

For more, see [the crate's README](crates/lexeme/README.md).

If you are a highly paid worker at any company that prioritises profit over
people, you can still use this crate. I simply wish you will unionise and push
back against the obsession for growth, control, and power that is rampant in
such workplaces. Please take a stand against the horrible working conditions
they inflict on your lesser paid colleagues, and more generally their
disrespect for the very human rights they typically claim to fight for.
